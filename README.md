# HackTernoons

Welcome to NeurotechUofT HackTernoons! This is a general hacking session for **all people that are interested in neurotechnology**. We have EEG headsets and resources all available for use! Come and hack with us: **learn, research, develop your own projects/experiments, and/or contribute to our club projects**. If you don't have a general idea of what to do BUT have any sort of interest in neurotech, you can use our task board as inspiration or guide to what you could work on. Plus, there's **free coffee and donuts**! 

## New Members

New to neuroscience and neurotechnology? **No problem!** Follw this quick start-up guide to get you more familiarized with the **why, importance, and basics of neuroscience**. Then we will guide you through **programming fundamentals** to give you a **foundation to develop neurotech apps/experiments**. Feel free to skip over concepts you are already comfortable with. First, we would first like you to create a github account as most of our material is on this github repository. Follow through our Start Here! tasks on our task board to get started!

## Experienced Members

Great now you've finished the start-up guide OR you are already familiar with neuroscience and progamming. Now what? This depends on what your goals are with neurotech. 

#### Research/Experiments

Currently, we are working on our own EEG headset interfacing program that will help with data collection, analysis, preprocessing. However, if you wish to collect or play around with raw EEG data, feel free to grab one of our headsets and use angular muse

#### App development

If you already have an app idea in mind, start hacking away at our HackTernoons! If you require further research or knowledge then you can resort to our NeurotechTheory Tasks to guide you through.

If you don't have an idea, that's ok too! You can do our Computer Science Tasks to build smaller apps and use those as inspiration!

#### Contributing to club projects

Currently, we are working out the specifics of our own EEG headset interfacing program. We will have tasks that YOU can do to develop this program soon.
